    <h1>CSS Syntax Examples</h1>
    <p>The basic goal of the Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) language is to allow a browser engine to paint elements of the page with specific features, like colors, positioning, or decorations. The CSS syntax reflects this goal and its basic building blocks are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The property which is an identifier, that is a human-readable name, that defines which feature is considered.
      </li>
      <li>
        The value which describe how the feature must be handled by the engine. Each property has a set of valid values, defined by a formal grammar, as well as a semantic meaning, implemented by the browser engine.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
